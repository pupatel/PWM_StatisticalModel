PWM_StatisicalModel - Position Weigh Matrix for assesing differences in two types of smallRNA sequences using the position-speciﬁc base usage by conducting a two-tailed,rank sum test (P = 1e^5) to identify positions with statistically signiﬁcant base usage that would distinguish these two types of sequences.
